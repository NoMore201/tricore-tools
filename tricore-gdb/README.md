# Tricore GDB package

This folder contains the tricore GDB PKGBUILD for the MSYS2 framework (more info: https://www.msys2.org).

The PKGBUILD and patches 0001, 0002 and 0005 are based on the [gdb package in MINGW-packages repository](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/tree/cfc3558eafad71aab2befd581d66c9e5375375cb/mingw-w64-gdb).

Patch 0006 was created by re-applying all changes found in [this repo](https://github.com/Gigallith/gdb-tricore)
to latest 11.2 release of binutils-gdb
